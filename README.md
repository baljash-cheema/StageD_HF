# StageD_HF

This repo contains code for various machine learning approaches designed to identify whether an individual has Stage C or Stage D HF, based on established risk factors collectively found in three risk scores (Seattle Heart Failure Model; MAGGIC, Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure Risk Calculator; MARKER-HF, Machine learning Assessment of RisK and EaRly mortality in Heart Failure) along with expert consensus.

These models were trained on private health information such as diagnoses, treatment information, medical test results, and prescription information that is protected under HIPAA, but no patient data is shared in this public repo. This repo is only meant to share the code underlying the models.

The code in this repo reflects shared work completed in various research projects as well as course work in a Masters
in Artificial Intelligence training program and thus reflects the collective insights and work of several individuals.
A sincere attempt is made in all cases to give credit where credit is due.
